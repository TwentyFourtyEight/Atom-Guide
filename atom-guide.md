# Atom Guide
Your favorite text editor now has a guide!
Please check your atom version before you
look at this guide. This guide refers to
Atom Stable (with a green icon). If you want
to look at the guides for Atom Beta/Nightly,
please go to beta-guide.md for Beta and
nightly-guide.md for Nightly. If you are using
Stable look at the section on Stable below.

As always, a visual table will also be below.
